This is a PHP web Project for leave apply system.

Install a Web Server: You can use Apache, Nginx, or even PHP's built-in web server for development purposes.

Apache: You can install Apache by downloading and installing XAMPP (for Windows) or MAMP (for macOS).
Nginx: Nginx can be installed separately, but it's a bit more involved. You might prefer XAMPP or WampServer for simplicity.
PHP Built-in Server: For simple projects, PHP has a built-in web server that you can start from the command line. Navigate to your project directory in the terminal and run php -S localhost:8000.
Set Up Your Project Files: Place your PHP files in the web server's document root directory. This directory is usually named htdocs for XAMPP or www for WampServer. If you're using the PHP built-in server, place your files wherever you want.

Start the Web Server: Start your web server. If you're using XAMPP or MAMP, start Apache. If you're using the PHP built-in server, start it with the command mentioned above.

Access Your Project: Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost or http://localhost:8000 (if you're using the PHP built-in server). You should see your project files listed there.

Interact with Your PHP Pages: Click on the PHP files you want to run. They should be executed by the server, and you'll see the output in your browser.

Debugging: If something doesn't work as expected, check your PHP error logs (error_log in your PHP configuration) or enable error reporting in your PHP files to see what's going wrong.
